Upgrading Spur
==============

This page covers upgrading Spur binaries, whether on a single host or across a whole
cluster. It describes the ``spur self-update`` self-updater, re-running ``install.sh``,
and the Ansible playbooks that upgrade a running cluster with or without an outage.

.. note::

   There are two upgrade scopes: **upgrading the binaries on a single host** and
   **upgrading a whole cluster**. There is **no in-process hot-swap** that preserves
   running jobs inside a single daemon process. ``spur self-update`` only swaps the
   binaries on disk — it does **not** restart the daemons. The drain-aware, jobs-preserving
   cluster path is the Ansible ``rolling_upgrade.yml`` playbook (see below).

Single-Host: ``spur self-update``
---------------------------------

``spur self-update`` downloads the latest release and replaces the ``spur``, ``spurctld``,
and ``spurd`` binaries on the current host. It is a single-host convenience: it does not
restart daemons and gives no drain or quorum protection, so it is not a substitute for the
cluster playbooks below.

Check whether an update is available:

.. code-block:: bash

   spur version --check

.. code-block:: text

   update available: 0.3.0 → v0.3.1
   Run `spur self-update` to install.

Install the update:

.. code-block:: bash

   spur self-update

``spur update`` is an alias for ``spur self-update``. Add ``--nightly`` to pull from the
nightly channel instead of the latest stable release:

.. code-block:: bash

   spur self-update --nightly

The updater downloads the release tarball, verifies it against its published SHA256
checksum, then replaces each binary atomically: the current binary is renamed to
``<name>.spur-old`` as a backup, the new binary is copied into place, and the backups are
deleted on success. If any copy fails, the ``.spur-old`` backup is restored. The install
directory is auto-detected as wherever the running ``spur`` binary already lives.

After a successful update the CLI prints:

.. code-block:: text

   Updated spur to v0.3.1
   Note: Restart running daemons (spurctld, spurd) to use the new version.

.. warning::

   ``spur self-update`` never restarts daemons. Running ``spurctld`` and ``spurd``
   processes keep executing the old binary until you restart them yourself:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl restart spurctld spurd

The ``[update]`` config block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optional ``[update]`` block in ``spur.conf`` controls the daemon startup update check.
Its fields are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Default
     - Effect
   * - ``check_on_startup``
     - ``true``
     - Check the GitHub releases API when the daemon starts and log if an update exists.
   * - ``auto_update``
     - ``false``
     - Download and install an available update automatically. Even when ``true``, the
       daemon is **never** auto-restarted.
   * - ``channel``
     - ``"stable"``
     - Release channel to check: ``"stable"`` or ``"nightly"``.
   * - ``cache_dir``
     - ``"/var/cache/spur"``
     - Directory for the update-check cache (1-hour TTL).

.. note::

   Even with ``auto_update = true``, a new binary on disk does not take effect until the
   daemon is restarted. The config block applies to ``spurctld``; ``spurd`` never
   auto-installs updates.

See :doc:`/admin-guide/configuration` for the full ``[update]`` field reference.

Single-Host: Re-running ``install.sh``
--------------------------------------

Re-running the one-line installer upgrades an existing single-host install in place. It
downloads the requested release, verifies its checksum, and copies the binaries over the
install directory (default ``~/.local/bin``):

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/spur/main/install.sh | bash

Pass ``nightly`` or a pinned ``vX.Y.Z`` to select a specific release, or set
``INSTALL_DIR`` to install elsewhere:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/spur/main/install.sh | bash -s -- nightly
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/spur/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.3.1

Like ``spur self-update``, ``install.sh`` does not manage systemd units or restart
daemons. Restart ``spurctld`` and ``spurd`` yourself after re-installing.

Cluster Upgrades with Ansible
-----------------------------

For a multi-node cluster, the Ansible toolkit is the recommended upgrade path. Two
playbooks are supported; both reuse the same install, config, and health-check roles as
``deploy.yml``, so their behavior stays consistent.

Rebuild all three binaries from the same source tree together — they share a Raft
write-ahead-log schema, and mixing binaries from different builds can leave a controller
unable to parse a log written by a differently-versioned peer:

.. code-block:: bash

   cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd

Binaries roll out by content, not version string: Ansible compares checksums, so an
unchanged re-run is a near no-op.

Full convergence (``deploy.yml``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``deploy.yml`` is the simplest upgrade: it re-installs binaries and restarts every daemon
on every host in one play. This causes a **brief cluster-wide outage** — in-flight jobs are
disrupted, and in an HA setup all controllers bounce together, briefly losing the Raft
leader. It is non-destructive by default (state is preserved). Use it for topology changes
or when a short blip is acceptable:

.. code-block:: bash

   ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path/to/target/release

.. note::

   Spur 0.3.0 has no online Raft membership change. Adding, removing, or reordering a
   **controller** fails early unless you also pass ``-e spur_wipe_state=true`` (a Raft
   reinit that wipes state). Compute agents are not Raft members, so they can be added or
   removed freely without a wipe.

Rolling upgrade (``rolling_upgrade.yml``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``rolling_upgrade.yml`` is the seamless, no-full-outage path: it upgrades one host at a
time so the cluster keeps scheduling and running jobs throughout.

.. code-block:: bash

   ansible-playbook playbooks/rolling_upgrade.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path/to/target/release

The playbook proceeds in order:

1. **Guard rails.** Abort if ``spur_wipe_state=true`` (never wipe Raft mid-upgrade), if
   ``spur_transport=wireguard`` (not yet supported by this playbook), or if the cluster is
   not already healthy (``spur nodes`` must return success).
2. **Upgrade controllers one at a time** (``serial: 1``, no failures tolerated), preserving
   Raft quorum. Each controller's binaries are force-reinstalled and the daemon restarted;
   the "wait for Raft leader" step is the health gate before moving to the next controller.
   The existing ``spur.conf`` is preserved unless you pass ``-e spur_overwrite_conf=true``.
3. **Drain and upgrade agents in batches.** For each agent: drain it from the controller
   (``spur node drain <node> --reason "ansible rolling upgrade"``), wait until its state is
   ``DRAINED`` or ``DOWN`` (running jobs finish first — drain never force-kills), swap the
   binary, restart ``spurd``, wait for the node to re-register, then resume it
   (``scontrol update NodeName=<node> State=RESUME``).
4. **Verify.** Submit a real test job to confirm the upgraded cluster schedules work.

The rolling upgrade is controlled with these ``-e`` flags:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Flag
     - Default
     - Effect
   * - ``spur_binary_src=<dir>``
     - *(unset)*
     - Directory of pre-built ``spur``/``spurctld``/``spurd`` binaries to roll out.
       Unset → install the published release via ``install.sh`` (``spur_version``).
   * - ``spur_rolling_batch_size=<N>``
     - ``1``
     - Agents upgraded per batch. Controllers are always upgraded one at a time regardless.
   * - ``spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true``
     - ``false``
     - Skip agents unreachable over SSH instead of aborting.
   * - ``spur_skip_busy_agents=true``
     - ``false``
     - Leave a still-busy node on its current binary and continue, rather than aborting.
   * - ``spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents=true``
     - ``false``
     - Kill running jobs and containers on a busy node and upgrade it anyway. Affected jobs
       are marked ``NODE_FAIL``.
   * - ``spur_overwrite_conf=true``
     - ``false``
     - Re-render ``spur.conf`` from the Ansible template. Needed only when inventory
       variables changed; otherwise the existing config is preserved.

.. note::

   A larger ``spur_rolling_batch_size`` upgrades faster but drains more capacity at once. A
   single-controller cluster still has a short outage while its own controller restarts —
   true zero-downtime requires an HA quorum of 3 or more controllers.

Safe Upgrade Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   The exact-execution/finalization revision is a one-time exception to the rolling
   procedure above. It adds the ``JobDispatchBegin``, ``JobDispatchAbortBegin``,
   ``JobDispatchTargetClear``, ``JobDispatchClear``, ``JobDispatchCommit``,
   ``JobDispatchPublish``, ``JobCancelExact``, ``DurableFinalization``,
   ``JobFinalizationAck``, and ``JobTransientCapacityReject`` Raft operations. It also
   makes submission generation, run attempt, and worker incarnation mandatory ownership
   fences for controller/worker traffic. **Rolling or mixed-version operation is
   forbidden:** an older controller can neither replay the new WAL variants nor preserve
   the mandatory identity fields, while an older worker can acknowledge the wrong
   execution after a numeric job ID is reused.

   First drain the cluster and wait for the runnable queue and active jobs to empty. Stop
   every controller **before upgrading the first worker**, upgrade all ``spurd`` agents,
   upgrade every controller as one coordinated set while preserving its Raft state, and
   restart the controller set. Do not resume scheduling until every process reports the
   same revision. Downgrading after a new controller has written or compacted these
   operations is unsupported; restore a pre-upgrade state backup instead.

   The Kubernetes submission-incarnation revision is the same kind of stop-the-world
   boundary. It adds the ``SubmissionTokenCancel`` WAL variant and adds a submission token
   to ``JobNodeComplete`` so exact per-node completion receipts are replicated. An older
   controller cannot decode ``SubmissionTokenCancel``; worse, it can ignore the new field on
   an otherwise familiar completion entry and apply the job transition without updating the
   token receipt index, causing replicas to diverge in crash-recovery behavior. Tokened submit
   metadata has the same mixed-writer risk. Stop every controller, install the new controller
   binary on the complete Raft set, and coordinate the matching ``spur-k8s-operator`` and
   Kubernetes virtual-agent rollout before re-enabling ``SpurJob`` reconciliation. Do not run
   old and new controllers together. After any tokened submit, token cancellation, or tokened
   completion-report entry has been written, rollback is unsupported; restore the pre-upgrade
   state backup instead.

Follow this order for any cluster upgrade:

1. **Rebuild all three binaries together** from the same source tree — they share a Raft
   WAL schema and must stay version-matched.
2. **Upgrade controllers before agents.** Both playbooks do this automatically, one
   controller at a time to preserve quorum.
3. **Drain agents before swapping binaries.** The rolling playbook drains automatically; a
   running job blocks the swap unless you force it.
4. **Never wipe state during an upgrade.** Keep the default ``spur_wipe_state=false``.
   Wiping resets the Raft job-id counter and destroys accounting history.
5. **HA membership is fixed at init** in Spur 0.3.0. You can roll new binaries onto the
   existing controller set freely, but changing *which* hosts are controllers requires
   ``deploy.yml -e spur_wipe_state=true``.
